<subsection name="What Is James IMAP?">
<p>
A library providing a flexible codec for IMAP, command processors 
and a sample data access layer. In combination with a socket layer,
this library can be used to create an IMAP server.

<subsection name='What Is The Status Of James IMAP?'>
<p>
<a href='http://james.apache.org/server/rfclist/imap4/rfc2060.txt'>RFC2060</a> is functionally complete, tested 
and usable. However, the data access layer is considered unsatisfactory from 
design and performance perspectives. Database schema and API changes are expected.

<subsection name='Is IMAP Available In James?'>
<p>
<a href='http://james.apache.org/server'>JAMES Server 3</a> will support IMAP (using this library).
A backport to <a href='http://james.apache.org/server'>JAMES Server 2.x</a> would require
a volunteer.
